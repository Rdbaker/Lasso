# Lasso
A lodash inspired library for Rust

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Rdbaker/Lasso.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Rdbaker/Lasso)

----
## Motivation
The primary purpose of this project is to learn the Rust language.
Instead of thinking of some low-level project that I had a tough time thinking of,
I decided to copy the popular JavaScript utility library [Lodash](https://lodash.com/).
